This is a NextJS ecommerce app belongs to ThinhMQ, dedicated for the Decathlon technical test.

First, i just want to say that despite looking up many resources for the Single responsibility hooks's unit test but failed to sucessfully implement any,
Therefor beeing not able to fulfill the unit test using Jest brings me shame.
With that beeing said, beeing able to learn new things (NextJS, Tailwind...), putting my heart into this brings me great joy and i really enjoy working on this application.

With that out of the way let's get to my application's description.

Landing page:
- Will display a list of products fetched from the provided API.
- Product card will display product's basic info.
- Hover over product's image will display product's 2nd image.

Product detail page:
- Will display more detail of the product including basic info + Description/Availability/Reviews.
- Reviews of the product will be fetched via product's.

Additional page:
- 404 page.
- All reviews page (TBD)

Development tool/libs:
- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios

Testing tool:
- React testing library
- Jest

Deploy enviroment:
- Ungit
- Github
- Vercel

Extensions:
- ESLint
- Prettier
- ES6/ES7 Snippets
- Material Icon Theme
- Auto Import

Things i would do to improve:
- Unit testing
- Implement TypeScript instead of using JavaScript (Since working in big project TS would bring alot to the table)
- Implement Review page (via Amazon)
- Better design (via Decathlon design page for dev)
- Commit on every finished feature.
